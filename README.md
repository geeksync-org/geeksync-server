## Intro

The idea behind this project is to enable notification syncing between devices.

Nothing new.

But this time it's on your terms - no need to trust any 3rd party:
* fully open source
* you host your own server
* deploy server on LAN or in cloud
* end to end encryption without 3rd party trust
* compromised server? No big deal, server have access to encrypted payload only, does not even know device IDs
* customisable delivery rules 

## Project status

Current status: Initial stage

* Just got out of private POC
* Finalising HLD
* Defining scope for v. 1.0
